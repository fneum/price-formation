abstract = "This paper argues that a variety of imperfections in wholesale “energy-only” electricity markets lead to generators earning net revenues that are inadequate to support investment in a least cost portfolio of generating capacity and to satisfy consumer preferences for reliability. Theoretical and numerical examples are used to illustrate the sources of this “missing money” problem. Improvements in “energy-only” wholesale electricity markets, especially those that improve pricing when capacity is fully utilized, can reduce the magnitude of the missing money problem. However, these improvements are unlikely to fully ameliorate it. Forward capacity obligations and associated auction mechanisms to determine capacity prices are necessary to restore appropriate wholesale market prices and associated investment incentives to support the optimal portfolio of generating investments. The deficiencies of the original capacity payment mechanisms adopted in the US are discussed and the necessary improvements identified."

We use the same model and data, based loosely on California in 2030, to evaluate several options to stem the decline in value of these technologies. The largest increase in the value of wind at high penetration levels comes from increased geographic diversity. The largest increase in the value of PV at high penetration levels comes from assuming that low-cost bulk power storage is an investment option. Other attractive options, particularly at more modest penetration levels, include real-time pricing and technology diversity."

  abstract={Many integrated assessment models (IAMs) rely on the availability and extensive use of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to deliver emissions scenarios consistent with limiting climate change to below 2 °C average temperature rise. BECCS has the potential to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere, delivering ‘negative emissions’. The deployment of BECCS at the scale assumed in IAM scenarios is highly uncertain: biomass energy is commonly used but not at such a scale, and CCS technologies have been demonstrated but not commercially established. Here we present the results of an expert elicitation process that explores the explicit and implicit assumptions underpinning the feasibility of BECCS in IAM scenarios. Our results show that the assumptions are considered realistic regarding technical aspects of CCS but unrealistic regarding the extent of bioenergy deployment, and development of adequate societal support and governance structures for BECCS. The results highlight concerns about the assumed magnitude of carbon dioxide removal achieved across a full BECCS supply chain, with the greatest uncertainty in bioenergy production. Unrealistically optimistic assumptions regarding the future availability of BECCS in IAM scenarios could lead to the overshoot of critical warming limits and have significant impacts on near-term mitigation options.}

This paper investigates empirically the impact of renewables growth in Germany on German and French power price volatility. We find that renewables depress power prices on average and increase volatility not only domestically but also across borders. We also leverage market resiliency data to investigate the impact of increases in interconnection capacity. We find that power price volatility would decrease in France despite some contagion effects of volatility from German renewables production. Our findings have important policy implications as they demonstrate the need to coordinate cross-border support policies for renewables in order to mitigate the impact of volatility on power prices in coupled power markets.},

abstract = "This research investigates the economic penetration and system-wide effects of large-scale intermittent technologies in an electric generation system. The research extends the standard screening curve analysis to optimize the penetration and system structure with intermittent technologies. The analysis is based on hour-by-hour electric demands and intermittent generation. A theoretical framework is developed to find an expression for the marginal value of an intermittent technology as a function of the average system marginal cost, the capacity factor of the generator, and the covariance between the generator's hourly production and the hourly system marginal cost. A series of model runs are made examining the penetration of wind and photovoltaic in a simple electric generation system. These illustrate the conclusions in the theoretical analysis and illustrate the effects that large-scale intermittent penetration has on the structure of the generation system. In the long-term, adding intermittent generation to a system allows us to restructure the dispatchable generation capacity to a mix with lower capital cost. It is found that large-scale intermittent generation tends to reduce the optimal capacity and production of baseload generators and increase the capacity and production of intermediate generators, although the extent to which this occurs depends strongly on the pattern of production from the intermediate generators. It is also shown that the marginal value of intermittent generation declines as it penetrates. The analysis investigates the specific mechanism through which this occurs."

abstract = "Several studies have shown that the revenue of wind power generators on spot markets (“market value”) diminishes with increasing deployment. This “value drop” is mostly observed in power markets that are dominated by thermal power plants, such as in Germany. This paper assesses the wind market value in power systems where hydroelectric stations with large reservoirs prevail, such as in Sweden. Due to their dispatch flexibility, such hydropower compensates for wind power output variability and thereby mitigates the wind power value drop. The market value of electricity from wind declines with penetration in both types of power systems, but it tends to decline at a slower rate if hydropower is present. This paper presents empirical evidence on the relevance of this effect derived from market data and numerical model results. Our results indicate that when moving from 0\% to 30\% wind penetration, hydropower mitigates the value drop by a third. As a result, 1 MWh of wind energy is worth 18\% more in Sweden than in Germany. Sensitivity analyses indicate high robustness despite large parameter uncertainty: in 80\% of all sensitivities, wind energy is valuable 12–29\% more in Sweden than in Germany. The benefits of hydropower seem to level off at around 20\% wind penetration. This suggests that the hydro flexibility is “exhausted” at this level. Low wind speed wind turbines, carbon pricing, and upgrades of hydropower generation capacity can lever the added value of hydro flexibility further. Not only is wind energy more valuable in the presence of hydropower, hydroelectricity also becomes more valuable if paired with wind power."

Our analysis aims at finding the right equilibrium between market signals received by wind generators and their intrinsic risks. More market signals are needed to give the right incentives for reducing wind integration costs but should not undermine the effectiveness of support schemes. Although several alternatives combining support schemes and market signals could improve the current situation in terms of market signals and risks, feed-in premium support scheme seems actually to be the more balanced option. Furthermore, an adequate sharing of wind generation technical responsibility between the system operator and wind power producers can help to control wind integration costs even in the absence of accurate market signals."

abstract = "The price effect of the rising share of renewable electricity, which is called ‘merit-order-effect’, leads to noticeable changes in the German power industry and debates about the electricity market design. This paper estimates the merit-order-effect induced by variable renewable energy in the German-Austrian electricity sector with a multivariate regression model. The research focus lies on the impact of the estimated effects on the marketability of variable renewable electricity generation. The results show a systematic decline of the average market revenues for wind and photovoltaic plants in the period from January 2011 to December 2013. Current market data shows a continuation of this trend into 2016. According to the German long term goals for the use of renewables, wind and solar power will play a crucial role in the future electricity generation mix. If investments in these technologies will be profitable without any regulatory remuneration mechanisms in addition to the market revenues, depends on the further cost degression and the development of the merit-order-effect."

abstract = "One major avenue for policymakers to meet climate targets is by decarbonizing the power sector, one component of which is raising the share of renewable energy sources (renewables) in electricity generation. However, promoting renewables --in liberalized power markets-- creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100\% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. Ignoring these findings can slow adoption and increase the costs of deploying new renewable technologies. This paper spots the incompatibility between electricity liberalization and renewable policy, regardless of the country, location or renewable technologies. The Paradox holds as long as market clear prices with short term marginal costs, and renewable technology's marginal cost is close to zero and not dispatchable."

abstract = "The development of renewable energy technologies, their future market integration, and support scheme design depends crucially on the market value of electricity from renewable sources. The literature shows that there are many factors that potentially influence these market values. However, existing studies are limited in mostly just analyzing the influence of these factors individually or at most the combined effects of only two factors. In this study, a large number of scenarios for possible future electricity systems and the resulting market values are calculated. Results are assessed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis to identify the most important factors influencing market values. Therefore, we are able to quantitatively analyze the individual impacts of a complex combination of flexibility options, which can facilitate more informed strategies by policy markers, regulators, and market participants regarding system flexibility options. We show here that the development of CO2 and gas prices, as well as the conventional capacity mix is crucial for the development of renewable electricity market values. System flexibility including must-run requirements, heat grids and electric mobility become relevant at higher technology-specific market shares for both photovoltaics and onshore wind. Storage only influences photovoltaics market values even though assumed storage capacities and volume are high."

abstract = "Rising renewable shares influence electricity markets in several ways: among others, average market prices are reduced and price volatility increases. Therefore, the “missing money problem” in energy-only electricity markets is more likely to occur in systems with high renewable shares. Nevertheless, renewables are supported in many countries due to their expected benefits. The kind of support instrument can however influence the degree to which renewables influence the market. While fixed feed-in tariffs lead to higher market impacts, more market-oriented support schemes such as market premiums, quota systems and capacity-based payments decrease the extent to which markets are affected. This paper analyzes the market impacts of different support schemes. For this purpose, a new module is added to an existing bottom-up simulation model of the electricity market. In addition, different degrees of flexibility in the electricity system are considered. A case study for Germany is used to derive policy recommendations regarding the choice of support scheme."

We find that there are considerable differences between a market premium on energy and capacity regarding wholesale prices, support levies and market values, which are all related to induced negative wholesale prices in case of the former. This comes along with overall higher welfare as it allows RTP consumers to increase their consumption in periods of high renewable availability. Moreover, increasing RTP shares also incurs higher welfare gains in case of a premium on energy, with the deployment-relevant group of consumers that switch from a flat-rate tariff to RTP benefiting most. Our analysis thus puts the widespread notion that higher market values are instrumental for the deployment of high shares of RES into perspective.},

A top-down energy-economy model is used that has three emission reduction options: energy savings, a transition towards less carbon-intensive or non-carbon energy resources, and the use of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology. Five policy instruments - carbon taxes, fossil fuel taxes, non-carbon (renewable) energy subsidies, a portfolio standard for the carbon intensity of energy production, and a portfolio standard for the use of non-carbon (renewable) energy resources - are compared in terms of costs, efficiency and their impact on the composition of the energy supply system. One of our main conclusions is that a carbon intensity portfolio standard, involving the recycling of carbon taxes to support renewables deployment, is the most cost-efficient way to address the problem of global climate change. A comprehensive introduction of the capture and storage of carbon dioxide would contribute to reducing the costs of climate change control, but would not obviate the large-scale need for renewables.},

An efficiency oriented environmental policy fails, as it involves a redistribution of pollution rights, resulting in a strong and generally effective opposition of the groups that forego economic rents. The present paper analyzes the tradeoff between efficiency and political feasibility of several CO2 tax and reimbursement schemes, using a computable general equilibrium model of Switzerland. The simulation results indicate that a policy combining a uniform CO2 tax with differentiated labor subsidies preventing intersectoral redistribution is a better solution for the tradeoff than the presently existing tax schemes in various countries."

Uncertain financing of other schemes reduces efforts at initial project stages and planning permits become a major obstacle. (2) Project developers do not compete in price but for good sites under the feed-in tariff. Most importantly, turbine producers and construction services contribute to most of the costs, and face at least equal levels of competition under the feed-in tariff."

The solution approach, called stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP), is based on the approximation of the expected-cost-to-go functions of stochastic dynamic programming at each stage by piecewise linear functions. These approximate functions are obtained from the dual solutions of the scheduling problem at each stage and may be interpreted as Benders' cuts in a stochastic, multistage decomposition algorithm. Case studies with the Brazilian systems are presented and discussed."

In this paper, we utilize a dynamic convexification method that makes use of Lagrangian relaxation to overcome this limitation and enables the modeling of non-convex multi-stage problems using decomposition algorithms. Though the algorithm is confined by the duality gap of the problem being studied, the computed upper bounds (for maximization problems) are at least as good as those found via a linear programming relaxation approach. We apply the method to the strategic bidding problem for a hydroelectric producer, in which we ask: What is the revenue-maximizing production schedule for a single price-maker hydroelectric producer in a deregulated, bid-based market? Because the price-maker’s future revenue function has a sawtooth shape, we model it using mixed-integer linear programming. To remedy the non-concavity issues associated with modeling the future revenue function as a mixed-integer linear program, we model the price-maker’s bidding decision utilizing both Benders decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm through an illustrative example and through three case studies in which we model electricity markets in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua."

abstract = "Electricity market models are widely employed to study the role, impacts and economic viability of new technologies. Sources of arbitrage, such as storage and transmission, are increasingly seen as essential for integrating higher shares of variable renewables. Understanding their operation and business case requires models which accurately represent time-series of wholesale electricity prices. We show that the prevailing assumption of generators bidding short-run marginal cost, such as in the merit order stack, substantially underestimates the spread and volatility of hourly wholesale prices. To compound this, the lack of transparent outputs from previous electricity market modelling studies makes it impossible to scrutinise the prevailing methods or provide a detailed inter-comparison. We demonstrate a simple modification to the short-run marginal cost approach that delivers improved variability in modelled prices: allowing generators to make a spread of bids, below cost for their first megawatts of capacity, above for their last. Using this model we demonstrate the impact of price variability on the operation and profitability of storage, highlighting the urgent need for greater awareness of this aspect of market model performance."

abstract = "Electricity storage encompasses a disparate list of technologies such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity, compressed-air energy storage, chemical batteries and flywheels. These technologies can provide the electricity system with heterogeneous services of energy transfers across months, weeks, days or intra-days, power transfers for an hour, a few minutes or seconds, and can assist operators in load following, frequency control, and uninterrupted power supply. The paper presents a unified economic analysis of these technologies and services. We underline the role of charge and discharge durations as a criterion for economic segmentation of technologies and services. We highlight the complementary value of storage in electricity systems with a high share of low variable cost and low carbon generation (nuclear, hydro, wind power, solar photovoltaic). We also underline the limited substitution value of storage for generation with high variable cost (gas combustion-turbines or gas-oil motor engines), given the high cost of state-of-the-art storage technologies, the current low cost of fossil fuels and low price of carbon emissions."
